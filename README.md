### Advanced Data Structures and Machine Learning in R

This project features R scripts that demonstrate the implementation of advanced data structures and machine learning algorithms, focusing on applications such as predicting surfing conditions and classifying email spam.

## How to Run the Project

### **Prerequisites**

- **R**: You need R installed on your machine to run the script.
- **Required R Packages**:
  - `knitr`: For reporting features.
  
  Install the necessary package using R:
  ```r
  install.packages("knitr")
  ```

### **Execution**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-ml-data-structures.git
   cd advanced-ml-data-structures
   ```

2. Run the R script:
   ```bash
   Rscript advanced_ml_data_structures.R
   ```

### **File Structure**

- `advanced_ml_data_structures.R`: Main script file containing R code for analysis, prediction, and data presentation.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance or extend the analysis are welcome. Please adhere to this simple workflow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.



## üß© **Project Purpose**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Surfing Conditions Prediction using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- **Data Setup**: Initializes a data frame with surfing conditions including wave size, wave period, and wind speed, and labels whether conditions are good for surfing.
- **k-NN Implementation**: Implements the k-NN algorithm from scratch to predict if the surfing conditions are favorable based on the nearest known data point.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Email Spam Classification using Naive Bayes**
- **Data Setup**: Initializes another data frame representing an email dataset with attributes like frequency of words related to money, free, and gambling, then labels emails as spam or not.
- **Table Display**: Uses `knitr::kable` to format the email data set for presentation.
- **Naive Bayes Implementation**: Likely uses these features to predict whether an email is spam based on the frequency of certain keywords.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ KD-Tree for Efficient Query Processing**
- **Tree Construction**: Implements a KD-tree for efficient storage and querying of multi-dimensional data.
- **Nearest Neighbor Search**: Utilizes the KD-tree to perform a nearest neighbor search, useful in scenarios like finding the closest geographical location, or the most similar data point in a large dataset.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Euclidean Distance Function**
- **Function Definition**: Creates a function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points, crucial for algorithms like k-NN and for operations in the KD-tree.
